Thanks for coming to take a look at my website. Below are some projects I've worked on that showcase my problem solving abilities, adaptability, and technical skills.

## Omega Comp

This is the largest independent project I've worked on so far. I conducted market research to identify underserved needs in the audio processing software space, then designed, developed, and released a product to address them. I built the core algorithms and GUI using C++ and JUCE, and designed a purchase authentication service with Python and AWS. My direct involvement in both the business analysis and software engineering aspects allowed me to create a product that speaks to the needs of users while maintaining high technical standards.

You can find Omega Comp [here](https://daybreakaudio.com/).

I've also made some of the source code available [here](https://jordan-rudolph.github.io/404).

## Phytopolis

After being elected to the project lead role in Cornell University's Game Development course, I guided an eight-person team of programmers and artists through a comprehensive development cycle. I managed weekly sprint planning, handled GitHub repository administration, delivered on my own programming responsibilities, and presented bi-weekly project status updates. This role deepened my understanding of large-scale software development and strengthened my ability to guide technical projects from initial concept to final delivery.

I'll leave you with one of my personal favorite programming quotes:

> _Good programmers write code that humans can understand."_
