# About Me

My name is Jordan Rudolph, and I'm a composer and sound designer of seven years currently based in Massachusetts. I specialize in crafting distinctive sonic profiles tailored to each project's unique needs, creating compelling soundtracks and soundscapes that span diverse genres. Below is a list of some projects I've worked on, and some examples of the music and sounds I've made for them. 


# Grub Bug

Grub Bug is a title about a humanoid cockroach trying to make a living by operating an illegal, high speed food cart. While composing the soundtrack I opted to give it a jazzier sound, while still capturing the fast-paced, frantic nature of the gameplay.

# Le Goosery Store

Le Goosery Store is a delightfully silly game about geese defending their grocery store from raccoons who want to steal all their produce. This is the most recent project I've worked on, combining jazz and classical piano with a hint of cartoon mischief.

# GoreCore

GoreCore is an upcoming fps with a retro industrial aesthetic. I wrote the following track to acompany the Blacksmith boss fight, an all out chaotic brawl that serves as the first major roadblock for the player to overcome. The main combat sections begin at 1:07 and 3:19.

# RitualRX

RitualRX is a blisteringly fast top-down shooter set within a pastel paradise ruled by demons and cultists. I wrote the track below to play during the climactic bridge sequence, when the populace finally rises up against their rulers.

# Phytopolis

Phytopolis is a short platformer about trying to grow gigantic plants in a futuristic world devoid of vegetation. I used this track to acompany some of the early levels, where the player is still learning the mechanics and figuring out new strategies.
